  - Overall, really cool topic! I really liked the flow. Each step builds upon
    the previous step in a really nice way!
  - It might be nice to give the users something to do in each step? Instead of
    asking them to code everything at the end, can they "code along" with you
    through each step? E.g. Can you remove something from the current "Snippet"
    code in each step and have them fill it in?
  - I've done some grammar and sentence structure editing. I'm trying to help,
    but I don't want to erase your unique tone of voice! Please take in whatever
    feedback makes sense to you and ignore the rest :) Overall, I've noticed
    people really like writing run-on sentences. Don't be afraid of splitting 
    them up!
